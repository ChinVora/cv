              	Reporting to the CTO, working with other senior
                developers and tech leads. Specializing in DB disciplines (data
                modeling, optimization, embedded logic) but also have standard
                development roles. Have handled two large projects end-to-end, a
                couple of smaller ones and been involved in a tremendous amount
                of code review and tech plan auditing.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Google Search Appliance<br />
                  - Replace proprietary legacy search functionality with GSA,
                  yielding greatly enhanced search accuracy, speed, relevance.
                  <br />
                  - SAYT (search-as-you-type lookahead completion terms
                  realtime).<br />
                  - Near real-time management of expired/sold out deals by
                  syncing GSA index with memcache.<br />
                  - Leverage variants to pre-select appropriate attributes on
                  product page based on search (shirt color/size, etc) to
                  improve UI.<br />
                  - Add left hand facet-based navigation and filtering.
		</li>
                <li>
                  Vetted, implemented third party sales tax solution (Avalara).
                  <br />
                  - Perform taxonomy matching between internal product
                  categorization and government tax codes. Hefty ETL process,
                  outsourced manual work.<br />
                  - Implement custom code-level "caching" scheme which
                  pre-loaded potential tax rates based on user location data and
                  all warehouses of vendors with items in shopping cart to avoid
                  delays on checkout (as the web services call cannot be
                  asynchronous since we cannot allow people to check out without
                  an accurate tax rate).<br />
                  - Maintain dual system for a month to ensure accuracy of new
                  calculations compared to previously trusted system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introduced some PayPal features we were not using.<br />
                  - Implement Log In with PayPal (LIPP).<br />
                  - Implement Seamless Checkout (reference transactions) which
                  significantly upped PayPal revenue by no longer redirecting
                  users to paypal.com during checkout.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heavily involved in 6 month PCI Compliance Audit which
                  necessitated breaking one repository into three, moving
                  checkout to DB-less separate cluster and basically creating a
                  Service-Oriented Architecture between the three repositories
                  (user facing store, checkout, and API layer to facilitate
                  communication).

              	Worked with very senior team and CTO on various projects. Many
              	deployments daily allowed by strong unit test coverage and
              	continuous integration. Maintained 6 Mercurial repositories and
              	performed development on 3 vagrant instances. DDL perfomed by
              	Python Django models. DB included many tables with tens or
              	hundreds of millions of records requiring many operations to be
              	performed over scheduled summary tables and views.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Spearheaded and launched new platform to allow clients to
                  deploy their own white-label implementations of the flagship
                  product (leadsales). Provided full flexibility and
                  customization of look and feel, separation of form elements
                  across multiple pages, A/B testing with divergent
                  implementations. Seamlessly performed AJAX and backend
                  validation, session management, DB transactions, ad delivery,
                  confirmation pixels and ultimate handoff to IVR's/agents via
                  interaction with several Datalot API's. Services were Python
                  Django, AJAX API wrappers were PHP, dynamic form buildout was
                  done with Angular JS, DB was MySQL.
		</li>
                <li>
                  Piloted first implementations on above platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Completed two phase merge/revamp of two most heavily
                  trafficked pages into one page with tabular navigation.
                  Modernized many UI components (involved creating wrapper
                  classes for Highcharts JS, Knob and Datatables JQuery
                  plugins), provided realtime socket-driven browser updates to
                  any users viewing the same client page via Pusher by sending
                  messages over dynamic channels between DB-monitoring Python
                  daemon and JQuery listeners on client page. Dramatically
                  improved performance and load times by optimizing queries,
                  creating new indices, refactoring PHP CodeIgniter models.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created and launched several other Python Django services
                  <br />
                  - Geo and demographic filter/targeting management service
                  which verified client filters and added them to cache-based
                  filtering layer. Involved complex math for radius-based
                  zipcode filtering.<br />
                  - Replaced hardcoded internal product definition files with
                  data-driven product lookup service on new DB schema, imported
                  serialized Python objects and references into DB, wrote
                  library to rehydrate validator objects and access validator
                  methods to dynamically pass options out to above referenced
                  Python services to populate Angular configs to build forms.

                My time with EXPO began when I was recruited by the CEO to
                bring web development in-house and create the tech department.
                Department founding itinerary, completed within the month,
                included:

                <li>
                  Constructing initial data model (roughly 60 tables), defining
                  and populating static reference data.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Performing large scale ETL process to populate new DB from
                  legacy Joomla DB.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Completing and documenting technical design of platform
                  framework (still in use).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Establishing coding standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Initial coding (system utility classes such as PDO, Smarty,
                  Memcached, Shared Memory, VBulletin wrappers and scripts to
                  enhance product and review data via AWS).

              <p>
                After that I faced myriad and diverse challenges, the dev team
                quadrupled, the complexity of DB systems quintupled, the web
                site underwent several revamps and I extended the API across
                four new services. Other notable accomplishments:

                  (Internap) outage, to which traffic is rerouted via Amazon
                  Route 53 low TTL DNS (thanks Sandy).<br />

                My primary engineering focus for over five years was the
                design, implementation, maintenance and extension of EXPO's
                suite of web services. They are leveraged in many ways by over
                60 clients including Amazon, Sears, Walmart, Quidsi properties
                (Soap.com, Diapers.com) and 30+ brands within Procter &amp;
                Gamble. Roughly 1m hits/day are served. The overall software
                platform as it has stood for many years allows the sales team
                98%+ profit on all non-custom tech sales and revenue has
                increased for 16 straight quarters. Technologies involved at
                this point include PHP, Apache, MySQL, Memcached, Graphite,
                jQuery, Node.js, and LogiXML. While my time there was not
                exceptional in terms of traffic or scale statistics, it was
                an incredible opportunity for growth and learning.
