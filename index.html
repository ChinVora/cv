              <p>
                My time with EXPO began when I was recruited by the CEO to
                bring web development in-house and create the tech department.
                Department founding itinerary, completed within the month,
                included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Appraising and ultimately scrapping inherited outsourced
                  Joomla-based system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Constructing initial data model (roughly 60 tables), defining
                  and populating static reference data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Setting up recurring sync with third party location DB
                  provider for international geo-IP, city, state, country, zip
                  code data (hundreds of millions of records).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performing large scale ETL process to populate new DB from
                  legacy Joomla DB.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Completing and documenting technical design of platform
                  framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Establishing coding standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Initial coding (system utility classes such as PDO, Smarty,
                  Memcached, Shared Memory, VBulletin wrappers and scripts to
                  enhance product and review data via AWS).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hiring second developer, who is still with the company.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Since then I have faced myriad and diverse challenges,
                the dev team has quadrupled, the complexity of DB systems has
                quintupled, the web site has undergone several rewrites and I
                have extended our API across four new services. Other notable
                accomplishments:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Personally responsible for over 125 projects end-to-end.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintained technical leadership of dev team (currently 8
                  people) including guiding/auditing technical plans, onboarding
                  new developers via pairing, doing code and PL/SQL review.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed High Availability systems infrastructure and database
                  cluster involving:<br />
                  - Dormant backup master DB for failover in case of primary
                  master failure via Heartbeat, DRDB and virtual IP transfer
                  which seamlessly maintains slaving to slave DB's.<br />
                  - Live EC2 clusters in multiple zones in case of primary colo
                  (Internap) outage, to which traffic is rerouted via Amazon
                  Route 53 low TTL DNS (thanks Sandy).<br />
                  - Extensive caching schemes on Akamai.<br />
                  - Multi-server/farm deployment framework and process,
                  integrating necessary cache-busting with Akamai, Smarty.
                  <br />
                  - Proprietary distributed DB optimization/routing system
                  leveraging shared memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and implemented interactive coding test for developer
                  candidates to ensure proficiency in all necessary skills and
                  areas.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                My primary engineering focus for over five years has been the
                design, implementation, maintenance and extension of EXPO's
                suite of web services. They are leveraged in many ways by over
                60 clients including Amazon, Sears, Walmart, Quidsi properties
                (Soap.com, Diapers.com) and 30+ brands within Procter &amp;
                Gamble. Roughly 1m hits/day are served. Services provided
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Retrieving UGC video product reviews, our flagship product,
                  generally filtered by SKU/UPC/MPN/ASIN/ISBN but many
                  parameters and control features are available to accommodate
                  our highly varied client base.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Retrieving aggregate taxonomy based rating data, averaged and
                  grouped in several ways across product lines or categories as
                  defined by client.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Receiving and storing user feedback (comments,
                  &quot;Likes,&quot; Hot or Not style votes, ratings) on any
                  content we host which can include client-generated
                  professional media in addition to UGC. All systems are
                  flexible and configurable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Retrieving previously recorded user feedback. A user
                  identifier can be passed to enhance UX so feedback left by
                  that user on any content returned is called out. On expotv.com
                  I have recently extended user-specific functionality to guest
                  users by increasing PHP session entropy length. This
                  functionality also exists in the main review lookup call but
                  the feedback lookup response is much lighter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Providing a nightly generated feed of a client's entire
                  licensed review library for clients who wish to cache data
                  locally and/or have extremely large product catalogs. Feeds
                  can include hundreds of thousands of reviews, hundreds of
                  megabytes of XML.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The overall software platform as it has stood for many years
                allows the sales team 98%+ profit on all non-custom tech sales
                and revenue has increased for 16 straight quarters. Technologies
                involved at this point include PHP, Apache, MySQL, Memcached,
                Graphite, jQuery, Node.js, and LogiXML. While my time here has
                not been exceptional in terms of traffic or scale statistics,
                it has been an incredible opportunity for growth and learning.
